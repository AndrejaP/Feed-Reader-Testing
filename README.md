# Project Overview

This project is a part of the Frontend Web Development Nanodegree course. I was given the starter code, 
a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I was required to use Jasmine to write a number of tests 
against the application. Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application 
including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript. With good tests you can quickly analyze whether new code breaks
an existing feature within a codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.

## Installation

Clone the repository or download and unzip the zip file in any folder on your computer.
Click on the index.html file to open it in your browser.

##  Tests That Were Implemented

* The test that checks if the allFeeds variable has been defined and that it is not empty. 
* The test that checks if each feed has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
* The test that checks if each feed has a name defined and that the name is not empty. 
* The test that checks if the menu element is hidden by default.
* The test that checks if the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
* The test that checks if the loadFeed function has at least a single '.entry' element within the '.feed' container.
* The test that ensures that the content actually changes when a new feed is loaded.
